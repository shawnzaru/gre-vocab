# gre-vocab
A Wordpress plugin to randomly display GRE words on a webpage

A quick hack to save dictionary lookup time while I was preparing for my GRE test in late 2016. Didn't end up in the US though.

In total 7872 words were collected from two versions of the New Oriental Red Book (新东方红宝书) using ABBYY Fine Reader OCR.

For each word urls were given to different online dictionary websites: dict.cn, youdao.com, and etymonline.com

If you click on those urls too frequently you might be treated as a crawler. :)

Rock n' Roll. Cram n' Rote.
